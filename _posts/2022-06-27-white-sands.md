## Day 3 (continued): arrive at White Sands

We arrived at Oliver Lee State Park after a ~3 hour drive and set up camp in a spot we had reserved. It had such a nice expansive view of New Mexico! Overall the grounds were pretty nice - they had showers!!

We headed right over to White Sands since there was time for a little exploring before dinner. The storm clouds were gathering though, and as we approached we could see rain falling – seemingly directly where we wanted to be.

Once we were there the rain had subsided, but some of the scenery it left behind was actually pretty cool.

The sand is white because it’s made of gypsum!

After, we headed back to camp for the night. And took advantage of the aforementioned showers. Day 3… I wasn’t even feeling dirty yet!

## Day 4: Alkali Flats then onto Bisti Badlands

We packed up camp and drove over to White Sands again for a longer dune hike: Alkali Flats.

Morning at camp was pretty hot — remember, this is New Mexico in late June — so I was worried about the heat of five miles on sand. Fortunately, we had some cloud cover, but we still each drank all of the three or four liters of water we brought.

Five miles was a bit much since the scenery wasn’t very varied, but there were still some cool things about it. For one, you can run down the steep dunes and let yourself slide a bit in each step, making it feel like you’re gliding down the hill.

Also it’s right next to White Sands missile range. The park actually has to shut down some days when testing happens (next closure was 5 days away!). I guess this is mostly just cool in theory since it’s not like we saw any missiles.

After this we hopped in the car and drove 2 more hours to our next campground near the Bisti Badlands!
