After Olympic NP, we traveled to Vancouver to finally do our meetup with our friends who came there from SF. Being with friends, I mostly put the camera away, forgot about this blog, and just hung out with them. So, our time in Vancouver isn't as well documented, and this post is short. But I'd be remiss if I didn't at least share a few pics I snapped!

## Day 54 & 55: Vancouver
<!-- 8/13, 8/14 vancouver -->

Saturday was basically: go be a tourist in Vancouver. We walked around Stanley Park and a few nearby sights.

We were lucky enough that our friends' family offered to take us all out for a day in the waters of the Strait of Georgia on a small yacht they owned. So fancy. This was how we spent most of Sunday.

I came away from this weekend really romanticizing Vancouver in my head, and dreamed about living here for a bit. We had good food, we enjoyed some nature, and got to hang out on a boat. How could a weekend be better spent! This was August, and the weather was perfect. I loved the suburban feel of the areas just outside downtown Vancouver. Amazing hiking is only a few hours' drive away, and in the winter there'd be amazing skiing just a short drive up north. I know I'm extrapolating too much from just two really nice days, but it's hard not to.

I am reminded of the mechanic who fixed our first flat tire in Texas. He saw our packed trunk and asked where we were headed, and I answered, "all the way up to Canada!" His response seemed to assume that we were permanently moving there: "ah, running away from all the bullsh\*t going on in this country?"

Based on that I am not sure if our political views were aligned or completely opposite, and I didn't want to ask. But we could agree on one thing: Canada seemed like a nice place to be.
