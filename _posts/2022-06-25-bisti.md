## Finding a place to sleep on Day 4
On the previous three nights, we had booked a site at a campground in advance, so we knew where we'd be staying and that we'd have a spot. This was the first night where we planned to do dispersed camping: free camping on federal land that's usually in a site with little-to-no facilities (bathrooms, water, etc.), and is always first-come-first-serve.

We looked up a few "campgrounds" from the NPS website and found three potential places to stay. I was nervous because each was an hour drive from the others, and we were only on track to arrive around sunset, so if we got it wrong we might be driving into the night.

Our first try was Angel's Peak campground, and not only did we find a spot (phew!), but the scenery was incredible. There were actually plenty of open spots. I guess it makes sense, this area is pretty remote and we had to drive six miles down a rough dirt road to get there.
