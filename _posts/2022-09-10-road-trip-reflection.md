## Health and Nutrition

I'm overall a decently healthy dude, but during this trip is the healthiest I've felt in a long time.

## Exercise and Diet

A major part of feeling healthy was the frequent exercise; a typical hike for me (8 mi, 3000 ft) burns something like 1500 calories. Of course, I would eat more to make up for it, but would probably still end up at an overall deficit. I lost five pounds after the 81 days, but the resulting weight loss wasn't the important part. What felt healthy was to be using so much energy all the time and to never end a day with too much of a surplus.

The diet was also a major factor. The criteria we used to choose our meals was simple: (1) must be reasonably nutritionally balanced and (2) must be easy to cook and easy to store the ingredients for. We experimented with a bunch of different meals in the beginning, but by the second half we got into a pretty standard routine:

* Breakfasts - keep it light before the hike
  * Yogurt and granola + coffee
  * Instant oatmeal + coffee
* Lunches - easy to make, easy to carry
  * Turkey, cheese, mayo, and arugula sandwich
  * Tuna and mayo sandwich
  * Peanut butter & banana sandwich
* Snacks - for a variety of situations
  * Trail mix / Clif bars
  * Apples, clementines, and bananas
  * Chips & salsa
  * Guilty pleasure snack / candy
* Dinners - filling, satisfying, and balanced
  * Veggies + tofu stir fry + rice
  * Onion + bell pepper + sausage stir fry + potatoes
  * Lentils + potato + onion + coconut milk + indian spices + side veggie
  * Rice + beans + sausage + honey + cajun spices + side veggie
  * Pasta + red sauce + stir fry ground meat + side veggie

We joked about continuing this regimen even after returning home because of how simple yet healthy (and cheap!) it was.

### Not Becoming Disgusting

I joke a lot in the previous posts about excitement over getting a decent shower, which probably makes it seem like we are disgusting sweaty people all the time. We were not. I might be willing to get that way for just a weekend camping trip, but when you're doing this for 81 days you need a plan.

Showers were our way to reset and get totally clean, and we could basically always get one at least every four days. Many campgrounds had paid showers, and we were doing so much driving from place to place that if needed we could usually find a paid public shower somewhere along the route. Sometimes we needed to get clever like how we went to the community pool in [Sedona]({% post_url 2022-09-04-sedona %}), but it always worked out.

Between showers, a washcloth and soap went a long way, especially right after a hike. We had a big bottle of Dr. Bronners soap that was invaluable. Nothing wrong with stripping down to your shorts in the middle of your campsite and washing up there. During summer, everything was usually pretty quick to dry even without a towel.

And between washcloth washings, we had baby wipes. Baby wipes do almost as good of a job as the washcloth does, it's just more wasteful and therefore bad to rely on too heavily. But they're useful to have on hand any time you don't want to do a whole wipedown.

## Mental Health

Finally, the last major positive influence on health was the psychological aspect of it all. It feels healthy to be outside around animals and trees and wide open space. It feels healthy to meet your physical goals and even surpass them. It feels healthy just to be able to say you did this for almost three months. Placebo effect? Maybe, but if it works, it doesn't matter.
