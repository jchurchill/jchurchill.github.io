## Psychology & Mental Well-Being

I'll start with the obvious. It feels healthy to be outside around animals and trees and wide open space. It feels healthy to meet your physical goals and even surpass them. It feels healthy just to be able to meet the challenge of camping and hiking every day for almost three months. Placebo effect? Maybe, but if it works, it doesn't matter, right?

### Maintaining a Positive Attitude

The more interesting reflection comes from the many moments where my mental fortitude was tested: relentless mosquitoes, having to cook in the rain, trying to sleep in hundred-degree heat, having to drive until midnight searching for a place to sleep, and much more. Fortunately we never hit any issues that put us off track for more than a day, but the trip was definitely full of unexpected challenges.

In retrospect, the attitude I began this trip with made all the difference. I told myself there would be challenges, but those unknowns were part of the adventure. I saw everything as a personal test, as a chance to affirm that, yes, I could overcome this situation too. When the mosquitoes were biting, for example, I did not feel like a victim, because I chose to subject myself to nature when I decided to do this trip. Instead, I found humor in the pile of fifteen dead mosquitos amassed in our tent after five minutes of precision clapping, and pride in our skill of snatching them out of the air.

Beyond this trip, I may not have chosen to subject myself to my own human existence, but I'm certainly thrilled to have it and keep it going, so the lesson applies just as well. There will be challenges, but those unknowns are part of the adventure \[that is life\]. This perspective helps me appreciate the beauty in how spontaneity gives rise to a story, and to see myself as the hero in that narrative who proves that no matter what sets him back, he can keep his story unfolding. No doubt life will contain trials that are harder than a few mosquito bites, and it may be difficult to avoid the self-pity and self-doubt that creeps in at my low moments, but this attitude is an anchor I can return to.

Look at me, all I did was a bit of hiking and suddenly I've gone all Thoreau on you. I guess you get a lot of time to think out there on the trail.

I suspect there are many ways to develop this attitude other than an 81-day camping trip. You need a long adventure with lots of freedom to choose what comes next, and with lots of unknowns that will put you outside your comfort zone. If that's something you can fit into your life somehow, do it. You'll come out a stronger person.

### Having Purpose

This trip also made me reflect deeply on my own need to have purpose in my life. When you spend 81 days being an almost-literal [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus#Punishment_in_the_underworld), climbing peaks only to climb back down again, you kind of have to ask yourself, "what's the point?" Don't get me wrong; the views are great, but the views alone are not enough to keep you going.

Turning everything into a personal challenge was part of my response to this. For whatever reason, it feels like there is deeper meaning in self-growth. As long as I could convince myself that I'd come out stronger from having gotten through something, it felt purposeful to do it. Why else would I want to [visit Death Valley]({% post_url 2022-08-30-death-valley %}) in the summer?

There was a stark contrast between this and my normal life with a 9-5 job. I actually really like my job, but there it's harder to answer the question "what's the point?". I'm not saving up money for anything specific, and I don't have any particular vision in mind for what I want the rest of my career to look like. Working as a software engineer on infrastructure teams, my impact is so many steps removed from the human impact of the product my company sells, so that's not really a source of purpose either.



## Exercise and Diet

I'm overall a decently healthy dude, but during this trip is the healthiest I've felt in a long time. Exercise and diet played the primary role in that.

The frequent exercise was a major change from my norm; a typical hike we'd do (8 mi, 3000 ft) burns something like 1500 calories. Of course, I would then eat more to make up for it, but would probably still end up at an overall deficit. I lost five pounds after the 81 days, but the resulting weight loss wasn't the important part. What felt healthy was to be using so much energy all the time and to never end a day with too much of a surplus.

The diet was also a major factor. The criteria we used to choose our meals was simple: (1) must be reasonably nutritionally balanced and (2) must be easy to cook and easy to store the ingredients for. We experimented with a bunch of different meals in the beginning, but by the second half we got into a pretty standard routine:

* Breakfasts - keep it light before the hike
  * Yogurt and granola + coffee
  * Instant oatmeal + coffee
* Lunches - easy to make, easy to carry
  * Turkey, cheese, mayo, and arugula sandwich
  * Tuna and mayo sandwich
  * Peanut butter & banana sandwich
* Snacks - for a variety of situations
  * Trail mix / Clif bars
  * Apples, clementines, and bananas
  * Chips & salsa
  * Guilty pleasure snack / candy
* Dinners - filling, satisfying, and balanced
  * Veggies + tofu stir fry + rice
  * Onion + bell pepper + sausage stir fry + potatoes
  * Lentils + potato + onion + coconut milk + indian spices + side veggie
  * Rice + beans + sausage + honey + cajun spices + side veggie
  * Pasta + red sauce + stir fry ground meat + side veggie

We joked about continuing this regimen even after returning home because of how simple yet healthy (and cheap!) it was.

## Not Becoming Disgusting

I joke a lot in the previous posts about excitement over getting a decent shower, which probably makes it seem like we were disgusting sweaty people all the time. We were not. I might be willing to get that way for just a weekend camping trip, but when you're doing this for 81 days, you need a plan.

Showers were our way to reset and get totally clean, and we could basically always get one at least every four days. Many campgrounds had paid showers, and we were doing so much driving from place to place that if needed we could usually find a paid public shower somewhere along the route. Sometimes we needed to get clever, like how we went to the community pool in [Sedona]({% post_url 2022-09-04-sedona %}), but it always worked out.

Between showers, a washcloth and soap went a long way, especially right after a hike. We had a big bottle of Dr. Bronners soap that was invaluable. Nothing wrong with stripping down to your shorts in the middle of your campsite and washing up there. During summer, everything was usually pretty quick to dry even without a towel.

And between washcloth washings, we had baby wipes. Baby wipes are almost as effective as a soapy washcloth, but are more wasteful and therefore bad to rely on too heavily. But they're useful to have on hand when you don't want to do a whole wipedown.
