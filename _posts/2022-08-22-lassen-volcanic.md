title: "Lassen Volcanic NP, CA"

Everyone knows about the eruption of Mount St. Helens, but few know that there was just one other big volcanic eruption in the mainland USA since the 1900s: Lassen Peak (in 1915). Since then the area was preserved as a national park mainly for the study of the dormant volcano. We're just here to hike its remnants!

## Day 59: xcxc

We arrived at Lassen Volcanic NP around 3:30pm after the four hour drive from Crater Lake. With only a few hours of sunlight left, we didn't form any big plans for the day. Set up camp, and do a simple walk around Manzanita Lake, the lake next to the park's northern campground where we were staying for one night.

The [walk around Manzanita Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/manzanita-lake-loop) (2 mi; 0 ft elev; yes, there's an AllTrails route for even this) was peaceful. It was more of a chance to just walk and talk than see the sights.

The one exception to that was this one spot where Lassen Peak and its reflection over the lake lets anyone feel like a professional photographer:

## Day 60: Lassen Peak & Mini Yellowstone

Lassen Volcanic NP isn't very big, and is another park whose main attractions we felt we could see in just one day. So this was that day!

The plan was first to hike [Lassen Peak](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/lassen-peak) (5.1 mi, 2000 ft elev gain), and then to explore the route through [Bumpass Hell](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/bumpass-hell) (2.7 mi, 400 ft elev gain).

### Lassen Peak

Lassen Peak is the park's highest point. It is a volcano, but feels a bit closer to a dusty mountain full of loose rock since it hasn't been active for a while. Its peak sits at around 10500 ft, so pretty high up there!

The hike was on the tougher side. Based only on elevation over distance it's a fairly steep route, but as the morning wore off, the sun intensified, and total lack of shade made it all a bit more challenging.

The landscape at the summit is indeed very volcanic, with lots of bare rock and loose debris. Most people actually didn't want to climb this high because it required a little bit of a scramble, so we had it mostly to ourselves. It made for some good pics.

### Bumpass Hell

After this we drove over to the trailhead for exploring Bumpass Hell. It's a... weird name. Better to think of it as Baby Yellowstone. Bumpass was the surname of the pioneer who was exploring the area and got badly burned from falling in to the boiling water near one of its hydrothermal vents.

It was cool, but having seen actual Yellowstone only a few weeks ago, it was hard to get all that excited about it.
