## Day 37: Jasper
<!-- Drive to Jasper (athabasca) -->

Jasper NP is similar to Banff in many ways: still in the Canadian Rockies, has similar hikes, and paired with a nice touristy town of the same name. Though it's also adjacent to Banff NP, it's a three hour drive between Banff and Jasper's town centers. I think it is often skipped because it's more difficult to get to and offers much of the same as Banff. My reaction to that: Jasper's like getting a second season of your favorite TV show!

The three hour drive is part of the attraction since it is scenic and has several stops along the way. The main stop is Athabasca Glacier, which sits across from a fancy visitor center. The visitor center even has a Starbucks which touts itself as "the highest elevation Starbucks in Canada".

This is also where you can pay to go on an Ice Explorer tour, where a bus with giant tires drives you onto a glacier (the Columbia Icefield) and lets you out to walk around. We didn't do it. It cost something like $100 CAD per person, and plus we had free ways to walk on ice at high altitudes. ðŸ˜›

Still, we stopped and checked out the "toe of the Athabasca Glacier", a short trail from the road that leads you to a point a few hundred feet from the glacier. It's pretty unique that this glacier extends so close to a road. It had displays showing how far the glacier had retreated over time due to climate change. It recedes something like 10 meters per year nowadays!

After this stop we kept driving until we reached Jasper town. We got some coffee (from Andromeda Coffee) and a sticky bun (from Other Bear Paw) that really hit the spot. Also, I sorely needed a haircut, and Judy found somewhere I could go:

    <figcaption>not only is it $10, it's $10 CAD (that's less than $8 USD!)</figcaption>
</figure>

Just kidding, I didn't ask a six year old (?) to cut my hair. (I'd eventually get one around Seattle.)

After all that we drove a short distance to our campsite at Whistler campground. I was excited about this one because not only did they have showers, but the campground was remodeled in 2021, so they were going to be niiiice.

The grounds were a bit bare, lacking shade; they had to remove a most trees due to a pine beetle infestation. But it was fine once the sun set. More than fine, actually.

Apart from the lack of shade, this campground would have been perfect. It was definitely the nicest one we stayed at the entire road trip.
