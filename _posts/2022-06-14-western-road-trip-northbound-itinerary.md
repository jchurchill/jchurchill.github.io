title: "Western Road Trip: Northbound Itinerary"
author: Justin Churchill

From mid-June to mid-September, Judy and I will be going on a long road trip in the Western US, mostly living out of our SUV, doing a mix of normal and [dispersed](https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping){:target="_blank"} camping. These are the rough plans for the northbound half, which should last about 6 weeks.
<!--end_excerpt-->

We are planning to hit the road on 6/21. We'd love to meet up with others for any part of it - message me if you might be in any of the parks or cities we plan to stop in!

#### Destinations
* [Guadalupe Mountains National Park][Guadalupe Mountains]{:target="_blank"} (TX)
* [White Sands National Park][White Sands]{:target="_blank"} (NM)
* [Bisti Badlands][Bisti Badlands]{:target="_blank"} (+ surrounding areas [1][Chaco Culture]{:target="_blank"}, [2][Angel Peak]{:target="_blank"}, [3][Ah-Shi-Sle-Pah]{:target="_blank"}) (NM)

#### Notes
* 8 hour drive between Austin and Guadalupe ðŸ˜µ
* We're skipping Big Bend for now. We'll hit it on the way back! Texas is HOT right now.
* Sadly, we must avoid the northeastern area of New Mexico due to the Calf Canyon / Hermits Peak wildfires.

## Weeks 2-3: Colorado

#### Destinations
* [Mesa Verde National Park][Mesa Verde]{:target="_blank"} (CO)
* [Great Sand Dunes National Park][Great Sand Dunes]{:target="_blank"} (CO)
* [Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park][Black Canyon Gunnison]{:target="_blank"} (CO)
* [Rocky Mountain National Park][Rocky Mountain]{:target="_blank"} (CO)

#### Notes
* For hiking, the second two parks have much more than the first two, so we'll be spending more time at those.
* Some of the peaks in Colorado are really high. Mount Herard in Great Sand Dunes is at ~13,300ft. Not sure yet if we'll take on that extra challenge...

## Weeks 3-6: Wyoming, Montana, and Canada

#### Destinations
* [Grand Teton National Park][Grand Teton]{:target="_blank"} (WY)
* [Yellowstone National Park][Yellowstone]{:target="_blank"} (WY)
* [Glacier National Park][Glacier]{:target="_blank"} (MT)
* [Banff National Park][Banff]{:target="_blank"} (Canada)
* [Jasper National Park][Jasper]{:target="_blank"} (Canada)
* Vancouver!

#### Notes
* There's major flood damage in Yellowstone as of 6/13/22 ([see cool/scary video from NPS](https://www.flickr.com/photos/yellowstonenps/52144418361/in/album-72157668680150793/){:target="_blank"}). We will probably have to skip it. Maaaybe it'll be partially open by the time we get there.
* TWO 8 hour drives this time.
* Most of these parks are huuuge, so I'm looking forward to spending multiple days at each. It'll be nice to have longer breaks from driving.
* I've been to Banff once before and loved it. Can't wait to be back.
* There's lots of nature around Vancouver too. Haven't planned that part yet, but will include it as part of the southbound itinerary, whenever I post that.

And that's it! The southbound trip will mostly follow the coastline until Los Angeles where we'll turn east to head back to Texas.
