## Day 77: Driving Until 1AM
<!-- 9/5 -->

### Solving a Driving Puzzle

Leaving Sedona, we had a logistical challenge: make it to Big Bend NP in Texas, at least spend a few hours seeing Saguaro NP in Arizona, and limit the driving to max eight hours per day. (Both of us struggle to drive more than four in a day. It just gets so tiring.)

To give you a sense of how far things were, Sedona to Saguaro is about 4.5 hours and Saguaro to Big Bend is about 10 hours. That's 14.5 hours – it could be done over two days, ideally with each having ~7 hours of driving.

Also relevant is that, after some research, we decided our visit to Saguaro NP could be brief. It didn't really have any must-do hikes, plus it was (yet again) crazy hot outside, so we wouldn't have wanted to do anything that difficult anyway. We really just wanted to take in the Saguaro cacti at their grandest, and we could do that by driving the Cactus Forest Loop in East Saguaro NP (yup, there's an [AllTrails for that](alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/arizona/cactus-forest-loop-drive)). That would only require a couple hours at the park.

This meant that we could probably concoct a plan where we drive to Saguaro, visit it for a few hours, and continue driving a bit more to some campground closer to Big Bend where we could sleep for the night. We found one called Aguirre Spring Campground that was 4.5 hours away from Saguaro NP, near Las Cruces, NM. That'd mean 9 hours of driving today – more than we'd like – but there wasn't really a better option.

Things did not go according to plan. But before we get to that: Saguaro National Park!
