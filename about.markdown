#### what is this blog

There was once a time back in the Myspace / Xanga era of the internet when your personal online presence consisted mainly of a customized webpage with a simple chronological feed of posts, and that's what I'm trying to emulate here. I guess it's a personal blog, but I just think of it as a way to share the part of me that others can know about if they're curious. Hi mom!
